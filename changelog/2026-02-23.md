# Shopping agent: first end-to-end run

Built the shopping agent and ran it for real — navigated to levi.com, found
501 Original Fit jeans in dark wash, copied the URL, and wrote results to a
file. All three tools (computer use, bash, text editor) working together.

## New: shopping agent

- Product philosophy and shopping brief docs
- Persistent bash session tool runner with sentinel-based output delimiting
- Text editor tool runner (view, str_replace, create, insert)
- Multi-tool agent loop that dispatches by tool name
- System prompt with clipboard workflow (super+l, super+c, pbpaste)

## Bug fixes

- Fixed sentinel leaking into bash output when commands don't end with a
  newline (e.g. pbpaste)

## Observations from first run

- 22 iterations, ~3 minutes, ~$0.25
- Model self-corrected when it hit a Quick Add overlay instead of the product page
- Clipboard flow works but is verbose — 3 tool calls to read a URL
- Observability (logged thinking + tool calls) was immediately valuable
