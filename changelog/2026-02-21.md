# Build out MacTool actions and dev tooling

Big day — went from a basic screenshot + key tool to a full computer use agent.

## Actions

- Added all click variants (left, right, middle, double, triple) with a consolidated handler
- Added left_click_drag with optional modifier key support
- Added cursor_position, type, scroll (with directional and modifier support)
- Added left_mouse_down / left_mouse_up for fine-grained control
- Added hold_key, wait, and zoom actions
- Every action now returns a screenshot automatically

## Agent loop

- Added the agent loop and entry point (WIP) — enough to drive a real task end-to-end

## Dev tooling

- Set up pre-commit with ruff format, ruff check, pytest, and prettier
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md and updated CLAUDE.md
- Moved tests to top-level `tests/` directory
- Restricted pytest collection to `tests/` to avoid picking up subpackages
- Removed unnecessary `pytest.mark.asyncio` markers (auto mode handles it)
- Investigated adding ty (Astral's type checker) to pre-commit — too noisy for now due to untyped Anthropic SDK usage in loop.py. Opened [#2](https://github.com/davenpi/computer/issues/2) to revisit.
